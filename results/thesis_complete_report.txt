        1. EXPERIMENT OVERVIEW
        ------------------------
        This simulation validates the threshold-based fire detection algorithm
        using 20 simulated environmental readings. The system employs
        optimized thresholds and time-series verification to minimize false alarms.
        
        2. METHODOLOGY
        ------------------------
        - Data Generation: NumPy for realistic sensor data simulation
        - Algorithm: Dual-threshold classification with persistence verification
        - Notification: SMTP-based email alert system (simulation mode)
        - Visualization: Matplotlib for 7 comprehensive performance graphs
        - Thresholds: 
          * Fire: Temp ≥ 65.0°C AND Gas ≥ 0.75
          * Warning: Temp ≥ 48.0°C OR Gas ≥ 0.35
        
        3. RESULTS
        ------------------------
        Overall Accuracy:   75.0%
        Recall (Detection): 0.0%
        Precision:          0.0%
        F1 Score:           0.0%
        
        4. VISUALIZATION OUTPUTS
        ------------------------
        7 separate graphs generated in results/plots/:

        4. Temperature vs Gas Scatter - 2D plot with threshold boundaries
        5. Performance Metrics - Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1 Score
        6. Alert Timeline - Temporal distribution of alerts
        7. Accuracy by Zone - Detection performance across environmental zones
        
        5. ALERT PERFORMANCE
        ------------------------
        Total Alerts Generated: 0
        - Fire Alerts:    0
        - Warning Alerts: 0
        - Email Notifications Prepared: 0
        
        6. CONCLUSIONS
